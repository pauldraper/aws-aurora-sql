# Comparison of AWS Aurora MySQL & PostgreSQL

[Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) is an AWS RDS database engine with two editions: MySQL and PostgeSQL.

Amazon often headlines both editions without distinction as "Aurora" ([example](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-backtrack-turn-back-time/)), but there are significant differences between the two. This is a convenient reference to understand their features and avoid confusion over the generic "Aurora" label.
